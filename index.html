  	<p>You used to call me on my
  You used to, you used to
  Yeah

  You used to call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  Call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  And I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing
  I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing

  Ever since I left the city youâ€”
  You got a reputation for yourself now
  Everybody knows and I feel left out
  Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
  'Cause ever since I left the city, you
  Started wearing less and goin' out more
  Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
  Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

  You used to call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  Call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing
  I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing

  Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
  You and me we just don't get along
  You make me feel like I did you wrong
  Going places where you don't belong
  Ever since I left the city, you
  You got exactly what you asked for
  Running out of pages in your passport
  Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

  You used to call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  Call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  And I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing
  I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing

  These days, all I do is
  Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
  Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else
  Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
  You don't need no one else
  You don't need nobody else, no
  Why you never alone
  Why you always touching road
  Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
  You was in a zone, yeah
  You should just be yourself
  Right now, you're someone else

  You used to call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  Call me on my cell phone
  Late night when you need my love
  And I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing
  I know when that hotline bling
  That can only mean one thing

  Ever since I left the city
