  	<p>You used to call me on my<br>
  You used to, you used to<br>
  Yeah<br>
  <br>
  You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  Call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  And I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  <br>
  Ever since I left the city youâ€”<br>
  You got a reputation for yourself now<br>
  Everybody knows and I feel left out<br>
  Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out<br>
  'Cause ever since I left the city, you<br>
  Started wearing less and goin' out more<br>
  Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<br>
  Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br>
  <br>
  You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  Call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  <br>
  Ever since I left the city, you, you, you<br>
  You and me we just don't get along<br>
  You make me feel like I did you wrong<br>
  Going places where you don't belong<br>
  Ever since I left the city, you<br>
  You got exactly what you asked for<br>
  Running out of pages in your passport<br>
  Hanging with some girls I've never seen before<br>
  <br>
  You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  Call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  And I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  <br>
  These days, all I do is<br>
  Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else<br>
  Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else<br>
  Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else<br>
  You don't need no one else<br>
  You don't need nobody else, no<br>
  Why you never alone<br>
  Why you always touching road<br>
  Used to always stay at home, be a good girl<br>
  You was in a zone, yeah<br>
  You should just be yourself<br>
  Right now, you're someone else<br>
  <br>
  You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  Call me on my cell phone<br>
  Late night when you need my love<br>
  And I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  I know when that hotline bling<br>
  That can only mean one thing<br>
  <br>
  Ever since I left the city<br>
